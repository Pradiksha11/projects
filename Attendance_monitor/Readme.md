**Face Recognition with Python**

    This project is a Python implementation of a face recognition system. 
    It uses OpenCV and other libraries to detect and recognize faces in images and video streams.

**Features**

    1.Face detection: Detects faces in images and video streams using OpenCV.
    2.Face recognition: Recognizes faces based on previously trained models.
    3.Model training: Trains custom face recognition models using machine learning algorithms.
    
**To run this project, you will need:** 

    1.Python (version 3.6 or higher)
    2.OpenCV (version 4.5 or higher)
    3.face_recognition(version 3.6.4 or higher)
    
You can install these packages using pip or another package manager.
