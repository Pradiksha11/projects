#  **Breast Cancer Prediction with Python**


    This project is a Python implementation of a breast cancer prediction system. 
    It uses machine learning algorithms such as KNN, SVM, and Naive Bayes to 
      classify tumors as benign or malignant based on their features.
    The performance of the classifiers is evaluated using a confusion matrix.

## **Features**

### Data preprocessing: 
          Cleans and preprocesses the input data to prepare it for classification.
### Classification:
          Uses KNN, SVM, and Naive Bayes algorithms to classify tumors as benign or malignant.
### Model evaluation:
          Evaluates the performance of the classifiers using a confusion matrix.

## Prerequisites

### To run this project, you will need:

      Python (version 3.6 or higher)
  
      Scikit-learn (version 0.24 or higher)
  
      Pandas (version 1.2 or higher)
  
  
You can install these packages using pip or another package manager.
